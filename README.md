Developing a simple C shell

**Hello and welcome to our C shell project! This project is a simple implementation of a Unix shell using C programming language**

## Features
This shell supports various standard Unix shell functionalities. You can run commands with arguments,
redirect input and output, pipe commands, run commands in the background, change directories using cd,
display the current working directory using pwd, and exit the shell using exit.

## Limitations
As a basic implementation, there are a few limitations to be aware of. The shell does not support advanced features.
## Contribution
We welcome any contribution to the project. If you notice any issues or have suggestions
on how to improve the shell, you can submit a pull request or open an issue. Let's work
together to make this shell better!
